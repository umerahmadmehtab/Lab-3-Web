Description:
We were supposed to create an animation of an aeroplane flying without using JAVAscript. I used HTML5 and CSS3 only for this purpose. 1st of all
a suitable background image was found and then it was added to a div which was set as an animation as an infinite loop so it felt that the clouds were 
moving. For the aeroplane I used another div absolute to the previous one. Now for the movement of this plane I made 2 buttons "Up" and "Down". This
was also done in separate div which was set as absolute. Now aeroplane position was altered by using these buttons so that we can control the movement of 
the plane.
Thank you.
